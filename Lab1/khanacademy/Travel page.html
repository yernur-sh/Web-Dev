        <p>
            The <strong>Maldives</strong> is a world-renowned tropical destination located in the <strong>Indian Ocean</strong>, consisting of <em>26</em> natural atolls and over <em>1,000</em> coral islands. It is famous for its "one island, one resort" concept, where each luxury resort occupies its own private island.<br>
