        <h1>New Year</h1>

        <p>
            The stars are bright, the snow is white, <br>
            The world is calm on this cold night. <br>
            A brand new year starts today, <br>
            To bring us joy in every way. <br>
            New hopes, new dreams, a fresh new start, <br>
            With love and kindness in our heart.
